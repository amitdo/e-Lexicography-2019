# e-Lexicography-2019
Course materials for the compact course in digital lexicography held at the University of Potsdam in February 2019

The 4-day compact course introduces you to the field of digital lexicography. We teach the basic concepts of dictionary writing and the techniques of computer-aided corpus linguistics using practical examples.

On day one, we will outline the goals of the course and introduce general notions of digital lexicography. We then focus on text corpora and their significance for the field.

Day two is dedicated to the practical work with text data and therefore conveys important methods for corpus compilation and annotation. We use `Python` for implementing these methods.

The third day leads to corpus-based knowledge extraction and its representation in digital dictionaries. We discuss the dependencies between text sources and resulting meaning paraphrases. The result of this process are dictionary entries in the form of XML data.

Finally, day four concentrates on real examples which summarise the course contents and serve as a basis for the course assesment in the form of term papers.
