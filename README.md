# e-Lexicography-2019
Course materials for the compact course in digital lexicography held at the University of Potsdam in February 2019

The 4-day compact course introduces you to the field of e-lexicography. We teach the basic concepts of corpus building, of extracting lexicographic information from corpora and of writing dictionary articles by using a standardized representation schema (tei-lex-0).

On day one, we will outline the goals of the course and introduce general notions of digital lexicography. We then focus on text corpora and their significance for the field.

Day two is dedicated to the practical work with text data and therefore conveys important methods for corpus compilation and annotation. We use `Python` for implementing these methods. In the afternoon of day 2 we will introduce tei-lex-0, an upcoming standard for the representation of dictionaries resp. dictionary entries.

The third day gives an introduction to corpus crawling techniques with Python. Our goal is to enable the participants to create their own corpora.

Finally, day four concentrates on linguistcs, the relation of corpora and collocations; we will also discuss the textbook "Oxford guide to practical lexicography". In the afternoon we provide a Q&A session for corpus crawling and we discuss possible projects for the term paper.
